# TaskMaster-Pro
TaskMaster Pro is a full-stack task management application built with Node.js, Express, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, view, and delete tasks with data persisted in a backend JSON file. The project demonstrates modular coding, API integration, clean frontend design, and problem-solving skills, making it recruiter-friendly and JD-aligned.

## Full-Stack Task Management App with Node.js Backend and Interactive Frontend

## Project Overview
- TaskMaster Pro is a full-stack task management application that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks.
- Backend is built with Node.js and Express, storing tasks in a JSON file (simulating a lightweight database).
- Frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive, aesthetic, and responsive interface.
- The project demonstrates modular coding, API integration, problem-solving, and software engineering best practices, making it fully aligned with Autodeskâ€™s software engineer JD.

## Features
- Add tasks: Enter a task in the input box and save it to the backend.
- View tasks: Tasks are dynamically fetched from the backend and displayed in a clean, modern UI.
- Delete tasks: Remove tasks individually using the delete button.
- Persistent data: Tasks are saved in a JSON file on the backend.
- Aesthetic UI: Responsive design with hover effects, shadows, and modern color scheme.

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Data Handling: JSON persistence (simulating a database)
- Other Skills: Modular programming, API design, asynchronous operations, problem-solving

## Setup & Installation

## 1. Clone the repository:

git clone: https://github.com/Alaina1713/TaskMaster-Pro
cd TaskMasterPro

## 2. Install dependencies:

- npm install
- Run the backend server: node backend/server.js
- Open the frontend: Open frontend/index.html in your browser.
- The app will communicate with the backend running at http://localhost:5000/.

## Usage
- Enter a task in the input field and click Add Task.
- Tasks appear in the list below.
- Click Delete to remove any task.
- Tasks persist between sessions using the backend JSON file.

## Key Learning / Skills Demonstrated
- Backend development: Node.js, Express, REST API, JSON handling
- Frontend development: HTML, CSS, JS, DOM manipulation, UI/UX design
- Software engineering best practices: Modular code, separation of concerns, asynchronous operations
- Problem-solving: Managing data persistence, API requests, and user interactions

## Future Enhancements
- Implement task editing and completion status.
- Add user authentication and multi-user support.
- Replace JSON file with a database (MongoDB or SQLite).
- Deploy the app for live demo on Heroku, Vercel, or Render.
